### Features
1. Profile : Users can signup/login to their profile, and then upload an avatar, pick a name, and choose from a tag (readers, authors, publishers). Users are prompted to verify their emails to finish the signup process, for security. Users can follow each other, and their follower & following count is displayed on their profile. 
2. Reviews: Users can post reviews for books they have read. Their review can be given a name and a rating, and will be displayed alongside the selected book's title and cover. All of a users reviews are displayed on their profile page. 
3. Shelves: Users can create shelves, which are titled collections of books. The shelves will be displayed on their profile page with their title, and are scrollable, so there is no strict limit to the amount of books that can be added.

### The Story
Zoya and Renee are third year Computer Science Specialists at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, and this summer they were looking to learn about app development and get creative. Zoya and Renee are both big readers, and they've been looking for an app where they could share this love of reading for a while. On a hot summer day, in the middle of Toronto, Bookworms was born. After the initial ideation, their biggest obstacle was learning all about the languages and frameworks they would have to work with. While it was a daunting task, and the app's features are far from finished, they have learned a ton about React Native, app development, databases, APIs, and frontend styling, and are excited to continue working on this app.
