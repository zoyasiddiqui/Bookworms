Bookworms is a goodreads-instagram cross, designed for readers to find and share about new books, and authors to get to know their readership. 

### Features
1. Profile : Users can signup/login to their profile, and then upload an avatar, pick a name, and choose from a tag (readers, authors, publishers). Users are prompted to verify their emails to finish the signup process, for security. Users can follow each other, and their follower & following count is displayed on their profile. 
2. Reviews: Users can post reviews for books they have read. Their review can be given a name and a rating, and will be displayed alongside the selected book's title and cover. All of a users reviews are displayed on their profile page. 
3. Shelves: Users can create shelves, which are titled collections of books. The shelves will be displayed on their profile page with their title, and are scrollable, so there is no strict limit to the amount of books that can be added.
4. Quotes: Users can create quotes, which are similar to tweets. Quotes can optionally be linked to one or multiple books. All of a users quotes are displayed on their profile page.
